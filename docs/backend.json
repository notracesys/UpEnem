It prioritizes authorization independence by using path-based ownership for user data. All documents in a collection share the same security requirements. The structure supports list operations securely (QAPs) via segregation. User data is stored under `/users/{userId}` to clearly establish ownership. This design eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules and enables atomic operations, enhancing security and debuggability."
