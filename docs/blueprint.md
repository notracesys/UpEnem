## Style Guidelines:

- General Background: Near-White Blue/Soft Gray (#F8F9FA) for a clean and modern feel.
- Highlight/CTA: Vibrant Orange (#FF6600) to draw attention to primary actions and CTAs. Based on the 'call to action' element of the prompt, which calls for bold, vibrant styling, the decision was made to use saturated hues.
- Authority/Text: Dark Navy Blue (#001F3F) for readable text and a sense of authority. The darkness ensures readability against the background, while its similarity to the main orange evokes the association of learning with trust and success.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, is suitable for short amounts of text, lending the application a contemporary and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective and neutral look, complementing Poppins. This font pairing has been chosen since longer lines of text can be anticipated.
- Fixed sidebar navigation for easy access to all modules.
- Welcome page styled like image 1000009055.jpg with a clear call to action.
